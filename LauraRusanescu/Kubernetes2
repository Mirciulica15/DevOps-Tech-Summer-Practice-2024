## K8s YAML Configuration File (1:16:16)

### Structure of a YAML File

A Kubernetes YAML configuration file describes the desired state of a Kubernetes resource. The file is divided into several sections, each with a specific purpose:

- **apiVersion**
  - Specifies the version of the Kubernetes API used to create the resource.
  - Example: `apiVersion: v1` (for core resources like Pods and Services), `apiVersion: apps/v1` (for higher-level resources like Deployments and StatefulSets).

- **kind**
  - Defines the type of resource to be created.
  - Examples: `Pod`, `Service`, `Deployment`, `ConfigMap`, `Secret`, `Ingress`.

- **metadata**
  - Contains metadata about the resource, including:
    - **name:** The name of the resource (e.g., `nginx-deployment`).
    - **namespace:** The namespace where the resource resides. Default is `default` if not specified.
    - **labels:** Key-value pairs used to organize and select resources (e.g., `app: nginx`).

- **spec**
  - Defines the desired state of the resource and its configuration details.
  - The content of the `spec` field varies depending on the `kind` of resource.
  
  - **For a Pod:**
    ```yaml
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-container
          image: nginx:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
    ```
    - **containers:** A list of container specifications for the Pod.
    - **name:** The name of the container.
    - **image:** The Docker image to use for the container.
    - **ports:** A list of ports to expose from the container.

  - **For a Deployment:**
    ```yaml
    spec:
      replicas: 3
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: my-app
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: my-app
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: my-container
              image: nginx:latest
              ports:
                - containerPort: 80
    ```
    - **replicas:** The number of Pod replicas to run.
    - **selector:** Defines how to select the Pods that belong to this Deployment.
    - **template:** Defines the Pod template used to create Pods.
      - **metadata:** Metadata for the Pods created by the Deployment.
      - **spec:** Specification for the Pods, similar to the Pod spec described earlier.

  - **For a Service:**
    ```yaml
    spec:
      selector:
        app: my-app
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 80
          targetPort: 80
      type: ClusterIP
    ```
    - **selector:** Determines which Pods the Service will route traffic to, based on labels.
    - **ports:** Configuration for port mapping.
      - **port:** The port on which the Service is exposed.
      - **targetPort:** The port on the Pods that the Service routes to.
    - **type:** The type of Service, such as `ClusterIP`, `NodePort`, or `LoadBalancer`.

### Example YAML Files

- **Pod Example:**
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: my-pod
  spec:
    containers:
      - name: my-container
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
          - containerPort: 80
